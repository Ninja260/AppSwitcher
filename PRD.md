# Product Requirements Document: App Switcher

## 1. Introduction

**App Name:** App Switcher

**Brief Description:** An Android application designed to provide users with a quick and convenient way to switch between selected applications using a persistent floating action interface overlaying the system launcher and other apps.

## 2. Goals

*   Enable users to quickly launch and switch between their frequently used applications.
*   Provide a customizable and easily accessible floating interface for app shortcuts.
*   Minimize the steps and time required for users to switch applications.
*   Offer a user-friendly way to manage the list of apps in the floating interface.

## 3. Target Audience

*   Android users who frequently multitask and switch between several applications.
*   Users looking for a faster, more direct alternative to standard Android app switching methods (e.g., recents screen).
*   Power users who want to customize their app access experience.

## 4. Key Features

### 4.1. Floating Action Interface
*   **Persistent Overlay:** The app will display a floating action element (e.g., a button or a small, expandable panel) that remains visible on top of other applications and the system launcher.
*   **Accessibility:** The floating action should be easily tappable and interactable.
*   **(Optional) Movability/Docking:** Users should be able to move the floating action to a preferred position on the screen or dock it to screen edges.

### 4.2. Customizable App Shortcuts
*   **User-Defined App List:** Users can select and add a specific set of applications to be displayed as shortcuts within the floating action interface.
*   **Adding Apps:** Provide an intuitive way for users to browse their installed applications and add them to the floating interface.
*   **Removing Apps:** Allow users to easily remove apps from the floating interface.
*   **(Optional) Reordering Apps:** Users may be ableable to reorder the app icons in the floating interface.

### 4.3. Quick App Launching
*   **Single-Tap Switching:** Tapping an app icon button within the floating action interface will immediately launch the corresponding application or bring it to the foreground if it's already running.

## 5. User Stories

*   As a user, I want to add my most used apps (e.g., Mail, Browser, Notes) to a floating panel so I can access them instantly without going to the home screen or recents.
*   As a user, I want to tap an icon on the floating panel to quickly switch to that app while I'm using another app.
*   As a user, I want to easily add new apps to the floating panel when my preferences change.
*   As a user, I want to remove apps from the floating panel that I no longer use frequently.
*   As a user, I want the floating panel to be unobtrusive and not significantly block the content of my current app.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance:** The floating interface should be responsive and not introduce lag to the system. App switching should be near-instantaneous.
*   **Permissions:** The app will require "Display over other apps" (SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW) permission. The permission request process should be clear to the user.
*   **Battery Usage:** The app should be optimized to minimize battery consumption.
*   **Usability:** The interface for adding/managing apps and interacting with the floating action should be intuitive and simple.

## 7. Future Considerations (Out of Scope for V1)

*   Customization of the floating action's appearance (size, transparency, icon style).
*   Support for shortcuts to specific app actions (e.g., compose new email).
*   Different layouts for the floating action (e.g., grid, list, radial menu).
*   Gesture-based activation/deactivation of the floating interface.
